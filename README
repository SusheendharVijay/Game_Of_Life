A remake of the wildly popular Conway's Game of Life. 

Its a small universe, where time progresses in a discrete manner. The unverse is inhabited by units
which can exist in two states, live or dead. These units come to life or go out of existence acccording to some rules.

The rules follwed by the units:
1.Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
2.Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3.Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4.Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

It's zero player game, it just operates with some initial inputs i.e position of live units.
